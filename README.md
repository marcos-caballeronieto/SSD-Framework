> **"Vibe Coding" is dead.** Writing random prompts and hoping the AI generates a scalable system no longer works. This repository is a **Meta-Framework** designed to orchestrate autonomous coding agents, eliminating hallucinations and context decay through rigorous specification.

## 🧠 What is this?

This repository is not a code template (React, Python, etc.). It is an **Operating System for AI Agents**. It provides the documentary structure, constraints, and skills (Skills) necessary for any model (Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0) to build complex software in a deterministic and auditable way.

**It solves the 3 main problems of AI-driven development:**
1. **Context Loss:** Resolved through the strict separation of `Mission`, `TechStack`, and `Roadmap`.
2. **Spaghetti Code:** Resolved through the "Planning before Execution" protocol (`/write-plan`).
3. **Lack of Verification:** Resolved through the mandatory use of automated testing MCPs (Playwright).
4. **Documentation Lag:** Resolved through the integration of **Context7 MCP** for real-time API documentation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/sdd-framework.git
   cd sdd-framework
   ```

2. **Setup your environment:**
   Ensure you are using an AI-native editor like **Google Antigravity** or **Claude Code**.

3. **Initialize the Agent:**
   Feed the `specs/agents.md` file to your AI agent. This acts as its "System Prompt" and operational manual.

4. **Follow the Workflow:**
   Always use the `/write-plan` command (defined in `skills/superpowers.md`) before any implementation to ensure alignment with the specifications.

## 📂 System Architecture (The Backbone)

The framework is designed for the AI to read hierarchically. Never let the agent write code without having read its "Constitution" first.

## 🔄 The Development Loop (SSD Cycle)

The framework enforces a rigorous iterative process to prevent technical debt and context drift:

1. **Plan & Brainstorm**:
   Use the `/brainstorm` or `/write-plan` commands to define *how* a feature will be built. The agent must reference `specs/` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` to ensure compatibility.

2. **Implement Feature**:
   The agent writes code in the `app/` directory following the approved plan. Small, atomic commits/edits are preferred to keep the context clean.

3. **Update Specs & Roadmap**:
   If the implementation changes the system's behavior or uncovers new edge cases, update the corresponding file in `specs/`. Mark the task as completed in `ROADMAP.md`.

4. **Re-plan & Iterate**:
   Never start a new feature without updating the state of the project first. The loop begins again by reading the updated `ROADMAP.md` and creating the next plan.

## 🏚️ Legacy Projects Integration

Applying SSD to an existing codebase requires a "Reverse-Engineering" phase:

1. **Document the Baseline**: 
   Before making changes, the agent must read the current codebase and fill out `specs/techstack.md` and `specs/mission.md` to establish the current "Source of Truth".

2. **Map the Application Folder**: 
   If your project doesn't use an `app/` directory (e.g., it uses `src/` or `components/`), update the pointer in the system architecture to reflect your actual structure.

3. **Incremental Migration**: 
   Do not attempt to spec the entire legacy app at once. Only create `specs/features/` for the specific modules you are currently refactoring or expanding.

4. **Baseline Testing**: 
   Before any `/execute-plan`, create a Playwright test that covers the *existing* behavior. This ensures that the SSD loop doesn't introduce regressions in legacy logic.
